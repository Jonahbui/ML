# Machine Learning Practice
## By: Jonah Bui

## Description:
The focus of this repository is to demonstrate my knowledge of machine learning concepts by building models.
I am currently working on mainly classification models and some regression models.

## Datasets:
The following sets of images were used in creating these models:
- ml_cat_dog: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
- ml_regression_1: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

## Directories:
- Practice: contains models made following examples and guides
- ml_cat_dog:a model used to classify cats and dogs
- ml_regression_1: a model used to predict student grade scores

## To-do List:
- Learn audio classification and make a model for it
- Learn how to use Tensorflow packges

## Technologies:
- Keras with Python
- PlaidML
- AdvancedRenamer
- IfranView

## Other Contributions
